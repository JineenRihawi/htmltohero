With CSS, you can change the color, font, spacing, alignment, and positioning of HTML elements on a webpage. CSS allows you to separate the structure of the content (HTML) from its presentation (CSS), making web development more efficient and easier to maintain.",
                "paragraph2": "CSS provides a way to style your HTML documents. You can apply styles to the entire page, or you can target individual elements, such as paragraphs, headers, links, and more.",

                "paragraph3": "CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them. A CSS rule consists of a selector (which defines which HTML elements the style will apply to) and a declaration (which defines what styles should be applied).",
